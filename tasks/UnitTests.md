Feature

**Short Description

Writing unit tests

**Text

As of now this tests misses unit tests entirely. Write unit tests for the classes from the following packages:

1. com.tcpviewer.proxy
2. com.tcpviewer.service
3. com.tcpviewer.service

Follow the following guidelines:

1. Use Mockito as unit testing framework
2. Write one unit test class for every application class
3. Place unit test classes in the same package as  the the tested class
4. Unit test class should only test the function of one class. So use mocks for the referenced classes.
